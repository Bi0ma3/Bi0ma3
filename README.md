# 👩‍🔬 Pipeline Bio | Bioinformatics & Data Science  

### 👋 Welcome!  

I'm a **biological data scientist** with a **Master's in Biological Data Science** and a **Data Scientist Associate Certification from DataCamp**. My work bridges **bioinformatics, data analysis, and coding education**, with a strong focus on **genomics, evolutionary biology, and statistical modeling**.  

🔬 **Key Focus Areas:**  
- **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology** 🧬  
- **Data Science & Machine Learning** 📊  
- **Unix/Linux for Bioinformatics** 💻  
- **Python, R, SQL for Biological Data** 🖥️  
- **Statistical Analysis & Visualization** 📈  

### 🚀 What I'm Working On:  
- **Continuosly Adding to My Tech Stack** 🗺️  
- **Developing Bioinformatics & Coding Content for Teachers Pay Teachers** 📚  
- **Guest Speaker for Youth and Higher Education on Bioinformatics Careers** 🎤  

### 📚 Teachers Pay Teachers: Pipeline Bio  
I create **bioinformatics and coding resources** for **high school students (10th-12th grade)**. My content includes:  
✅ **Introduction to Bioinformatics** (What is it? How is it used?)  
✅ **Sequence Alignment, BLAST, & Biological Databases**  
✅ **Python & R for Bioinformatics** (FASTA parsing, Biopython, ggplot2)  
✅ **Phylogenetics & Evolutionary Trees**  
✅ **Case Studies in DNA Analysis & Agricultural Genetics**  
✅ **Worksheets, Coding Exercises, and Assessments**
